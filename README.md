The R script (run_analysis.R) in this repository is a self-contained program to download, manipulate, summarize, and ultimately output a tidy data 
file as a requiremetn of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The data is accelerometer information from a test among 30 subjects using the Samsung Galaxy smartphone app which measures physical
activity.  

The data for this project may be found here...
